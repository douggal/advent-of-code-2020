             * I took an object oriented C# approach. Although verbose and not efficient of CPU 
             * it is easier to write code by breaking out the problem into objects with properties and methods.
             * 
             * 
             * The following rules are applied to every seat simultaneously:
             * 
             * If a seat is empty(L) and there are no occupied seats adjacent to it, 
             * the seat becomes occupied.
             * 
             * 
            
            If a seat is occupied(#) and four or more seats adjacent to it are also occupied, 
            the seat becomes empty.
            
            Otherwise, the seat's state does not change.

            Floor(.) never changes; seats don't move, 
            and nobody sits on the floor.
